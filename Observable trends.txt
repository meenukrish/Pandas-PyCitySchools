Two observable trends based on the data  - Academy of Py
 : 

Trend1 : 

The Top performing are from Charter schools compared to the District schools. The reading score of the top performing Charter schools are almost equivalent to the bottom performing District schools. 
But yet, Math score and Math passing rate make a significant difference in the %Overall passing rate. 

Trend 2: 

Based on the scores by School spending, the school with per student budget <$585 and between $585-615, amazingly seem to perform with greater Overall passing rate. So the higher per student budget does not directly correspond the Over all passing rate.   

Trend 3: 

When calculating the Overall passing rate based on the School size, I observe that the schools Small (<1000) to Medium (1000-2000) has higher passing rate. If the total students are Large (2000-5000)
  the overall passing rate seem to significantly affected.
